# 👋 Hi, I'm Abdulrazaq Adisa

I'm a curious and passionate **Computer Engineering student** who builds things at the intersection of **software, hardware, and AI**. I love shipping real-world solutions—from smart websites to embedded systems.

## 🚀 What I Do

- 🧠 **Front-End Developer** – I build responsive, dynamic UIs with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **React**.
- 🌐 **Full-Stack Projects** – Integrating with tools like **Firebase**, **MongoDB**, and **Cloudinary** to create interactive platforms.
- 📡 **IoT/Embedded Systems** – Arduino + ESP8266/ESP32 + Web dashboards. I’ve built projects like RFID-based attendance systems and smart device integration.
- 🧪 **AI & Prompt Engineering** – I explore AI use cases in healthcare and education, and actively build around predictive and generative models.
- 🧰 **Salesforce & Web3** – Dipping into **Salesforce LWC** and **Solidity smart contracts**, pushing the edge of what I can create.

## 🌍 Projects I'm Proud Of

- **Learning Management Dashboard** – An educational web platform with video/pdf support, progress tracking, and community engagement.
- **RFID Attendance System** – ESP32 + RFID card + web dashboard syncing student data in real time.
- **Itelp Engineering Website** – A clean, modern site for a solar installation brand.
- **Revolve & Marmara** – E-commerce and travel sites featuring modern UI/UX, routing, and dynamic content management.

## 📸 Beyond Code

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me doing:
- 📷 Photography and visual storytelling
- ⚽ Watching sports
- 🔬 Experimenting with hardware & tech tutorials
